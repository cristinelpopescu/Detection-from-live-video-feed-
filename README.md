# Detection-from-live-video-feed-
This files allows you to build a person detection using hog descriptors algorithm from a dji phantom v4 drone  video streaming

You need to install and run nginx server, change the config file.
I used for this: my diploma project written in python code with opencv module, dji drone for aerial-view video streaming, notepad++ editor for codes and windows terminal(powershell) for run and test functionality of the code.
Hope you enjoy to play with this files and build a lot of drone detection applications!
